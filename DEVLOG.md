# CURATOR Development Log

## Project Overview
CURATOR is an AI-powered access management system for luxury brands that:
- Recognizes high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) through facial recognition
- Assesses wealth status through ML-based visual cues
- Provides exclusive access management for luxury retail, events, and venues
- Offers analytics on clientele and engagement
- Developed in association with blackcode SA (blackcode.ch)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **CV/ML**: TensorFlow.js for client-side face recognition and classification
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing recognized faces and user data
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, hosted on Google Cloud Platform
- **API**: RESTful endpoints using Express for form handling and data processing
- **Development Tools**: Browser-tools-mcp for performance and accessibility monitoring
